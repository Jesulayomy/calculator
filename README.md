>- [silmultaneous.c](silmultaneous.c):
 A function that solves a silmultaneous equation. (need a way to collect output)
>- [quadratic.c](quadratic.c):

## :octocat: Undocumented Features :octocat:
![feature](feature.jpeg)
>- Repetition in while loop
 (scanf, printf, last else statements)

```commandline
Remember to make it collect input(done), 
and loop the exit and options(done, has extra features). 
Also find a way to collect and store two return value
-s(pending).add last result (done, doesnt work for 
quadratic and simultaneous equations yet)
```
